# Crazy Snake - AI Agent Rules (Cursor)

## Project Context
- **Tech**: Godot 4.5.1, C#, .NET 8.0/10.0.
- **Architecture**: Manager-based, orchestrated by `Main.cs`. Signal-driven.
- **Key Files**: `snake/project.godot`, `snake/scripts/Main.cs`.

## Rules & Standards
- Follow PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for local variables.
- Use file-scoped namespaces.
- Do not put heavy logic in `Main.cs`; use managers.
- Always use `dotnet clean` before `dotnet build` or `dotnet test` if "Duplicate attribute" errors occur.
- Run tests with `dotnet test snake_test\snake_test.csproj`.
- Refer to `readme_links/AGENTS.md` for detailed instructions.

## Godot Integration
- Scripts use `Godot.NET.Sdk`.
- Signals are defined with `[Signal] public delegate void ...EventHandler(...)`.
- Prefer interfaces from `snake/scripts/interfaces/` for mocking in tests.
